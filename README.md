Welcome to my project
Project Info
How do I edit this code?
There are a few ways I can work on my app:

🧠 Use the Web Editor
I can open up the web-based editor for this project and start prompting or making changes directly. All updates are committed automatically.

💻 Use My Preferred IDE
If I’d rather work locally, I can clone the repo and push changes. Everything I push will be reflected in the web editor too.

Here’s how I set it up:

sh
Copy code
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project folder.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server.
npm run dev
✏️ Edit Directly in GitHub
I can go to any file in the GitHub repo.

Click the pencil icon in the top right.

Make edits and commit directly from the browser.

💡 Use GitHub Codespaces
If I prefer a cloud-based dev setup:

Head to the repo homepage.

Click the green Code button.

Go to the Codespaces tab.

Launch a new codespace and start editing.
